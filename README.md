# Totally cool frogger clone

## Getting started

Open the index.html file in your favorite browser, i.e. Google Chrome

## How to play

Use your arrow keys to navigate your hero over the board. The green grass is your safe area.
Avoid getting hit by the bugs at all costs.

The goal of the game is reaching the water on the other side of the road,
but be careful: the evil bugs move at random speed!

Pay attention to your life count at the top left of your board.
If you get hit by a bug your life count gets reduced by one.
If your life count reaches zero, it's game over for you!
